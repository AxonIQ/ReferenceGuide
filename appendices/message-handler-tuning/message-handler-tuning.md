# Message Handler Tuning

Customization upon message handling can become a desired tweak in your application.
Think of changing how message are handled or what parameters will be injected into your message handling functions.

Overriding annotations is very useful to implement best practices that you have established in your team,
 providing defaults or restrictions of how annotations may be used. 
However, they can also be very useful when special behavior needs to be added to message handlers based on the presence of an annotation.
