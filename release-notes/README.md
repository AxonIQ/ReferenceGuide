# Release Notes

> Legacy Documentation Warning!
>
> Since the first of October 2024, we moved Axon's documentation from the "Reference Guide" to "AxonIQ Docs."
> You can find the latter at https://docs.axoniq.io/
>
> Hence, if you are looking for the documentation for newer versions of Axon Framework, Axon Server, or any of the Framework Extensions, we strongly recommend you browse to [AxonIQ Docs](https://docs.axoniq.io/) instead.

This section details out all the release notes for the Major/Minor versions released up to date for both the Axon Framework and Axon Server.
