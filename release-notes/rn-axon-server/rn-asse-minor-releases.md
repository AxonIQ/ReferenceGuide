* Fix: Handle queries with same request type but different response type
* New metrics added:
  - file.bloom.open: counts the number of bloom filter segments opened since start

  - local.aggregate.segments: monitors the number of segments that were accessed for reading aggregate event requests

Notes:
- Default value for configuration property axoniq.axonserver.event.events-per-segment-prefetch is decreased from 50 to 10.

### Release 4.5.2

* Improved performance for reading aggregates

  Axon Server is now reading events for an aggregate from multiple event store segments in parallel. The order in which
  Axon Server returns the events remains unchanged.

  Axon Server maintains index entries for the latest event store segment in-memory. The structure of this data has been
  changed to reduce the heap used by this index.

* Improvements in shutdown process

## Release 4.4

### Release 4.4.12

* Fix: Load balancing operations for processors should ignore stopped instances
* Fix: Stop reading events when query deadline expires
