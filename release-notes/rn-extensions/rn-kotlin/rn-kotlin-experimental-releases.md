# Experimental Releases

This page notes all enhancements and features that we have introduced to our experimental releases of the Axon Kotlin Extension.

## Release 0.2

* Issue [#16](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-kotlin/issues/16) marked the desire to introduce extension methods for the scatter-gather query.
  Contributor `hsenasilva` answered this call and introduced them in pull request [#76](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-kotlin/pull/76).

* We introduced a dedicated kotlin test module, as further described in [this](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-kotlin/issues/67) issue.
  This module includes extension methods for the `AggregateTestFixture` and `SagaTestFixture`.

* Contributor `zambrovksi` added extension functions for the `AggregateLifecycle`, to further enhance the Kotlin experience from within an aggregate.
  For those interested, you can find the adjustments in [this](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-kotlin/pull/72) pull request.

* We introduce dependabot to the project in issue [#43](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-kotlin/pull/43).
  This introduction means a lot of the changes are towards version updates to the project.
