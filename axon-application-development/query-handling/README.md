# Query Handling

This chapter we will cover the process of handling and dispatching [queries](../../configuring-infrastructure-components/messaging-concepts/#queries) within an Axon application in more detail. Queries resemble the "request for data" by some component, typically answered by a "projection" or "view model". The latter is what is called the [Query Model](../../architecture-overview/ddd-cqrs-concepts.md#view-models-or-projections); a model tailored towards answering queries, updated by event handlers.
