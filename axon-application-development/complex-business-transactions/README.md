# Complex Business Transactions

In one of the [previous sections](../../architecture-overview/) we introduced the term Saga and briefly explained the pattern as a good mechanism for managing your BASE transactions.

In the next sections we focus on Saga implementation details, testing, error handling, and deadline handling. Additionally, we explain how to make a good decision on when to use a Saga in the first place.
