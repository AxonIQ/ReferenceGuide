# Introduction

> Legacy Documentation Warning!
>
> Since the first of October 2024, we moved Axon's documentation from the "Reference Guide" to "AxonIQ Docs."
> You can find the latter at https://docs.axoniq.io/
>
> Hence, if you are looking for the documentation for newer versions of Axon Framework, Axon Server, or any of the Framework Extensions, we strongly recommend you browse to [AxonIQ Docs](https://docs.axoniq.io/) instead.

This section of the reference guide intends to cover in detail the capabilities that the Axon Framework provides to help build applications based on [CQRS/DDD](../architecture-overview/#ddd-and-cqrs) and [Event Sourcing](../architecture-overview/event-sourcing.md)

A summary of the various sub-sections is given below.
